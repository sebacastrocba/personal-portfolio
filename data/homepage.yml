  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>I love data science.</strong> My passion is applying machine learning to solve bussiness problems. But, when I am not
    building software, I enjoy vacationing with my family and friends. Also, I am a very good gardener!
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My area of focus</strong> is applying data science to business. 
    I create value for companies by understanding the financial
    cost of problems and delivering a return-on-investment with my solutions. 
    I enjoy learning, working with stakeholders, and making better decisions with data.
